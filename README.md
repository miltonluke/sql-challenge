# sql-challenge

In this project, I designed tables to hold data from CSV files, imported CSV files into a SQL 
database, and then several queries about the data.

Create a new database in pgAdmin and then right click the newly created database -> "Restore...".
Make sure to be looking at all file types while loading files and select "Sql-Challenge" in the "EmployeeSQL" folder.
Then "Restore" the database.
Tables should be imported and filled with the csv data.

Open new queries to load schema file used to create tables and load the analysis.
